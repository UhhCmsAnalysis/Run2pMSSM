# AOD-compatible TreeMaker

This is a customized fork of TreeMaker compatible with sideloading AOD files.

## Workflow

Custom scripts are available in `Production/aod_support/`:

1.  Run `create_AOD_filelists_from_datasets.py` to create your own list of AOD file names you want to process
2.  Place file lists in `Production/python/campaign/`
3.  Create dictionaries in `Production/test/condorSub/` with `create_dictionaries_for_AOD_filelists.py`
4.  Create a file name catalogue which maps AOD files to miniAOD files with `create_miniAOD_filename_catalogue.py`

## Supporting scripts

In `Production/aod_support/`, you can find
* scripts to create AOD file lists for custom dataset paths
* mark already processed ntuples as done
* run unit tests with AOD files

# Repo for maintaining Run-2 pMSSM results

```
cmsrel CMSSW_10_0_5
cd CMSSW_10_0_5/src/
cmsenv
git clone https://github.com/UhhCmsAnalysis/Run2pMSSM
cd Run2pMSSM
```

how to add a result

1. add a folder SUSYYNNN to idata [this has already been done for a few analyses

2. add files to to SUSYYNNN:
a) cme.txt
b) {counts.txt, data_bg.txt, lumi.txt} OR maxllhd.txt 

3. add SUSYYNNN to bashsequences/calcLlhd.sh, and run, and run:
bash bashsequences/calcLlhd.sh

4. add SUSYYNNN to calcZ.sh, edit combineZ.py, and run calcZ.sh
